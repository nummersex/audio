# audio
A simple application that converts wma files to mp3.
Uses NAudio.Lame which can be found on nuget (should auto-download and install upon first compile).
Uses console if filename is supplied or starts a drag-dropable window if no arguments are supplied.

Copyright is FOSS'y unless LAME has other plans (haven't looked actually so I hope I don't infringe on anything here)
